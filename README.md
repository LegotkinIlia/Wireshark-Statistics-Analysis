# Wireshark-Statistics-Analysis

# Project objective: 
To analyze captured network data through the lens of Wireshark Statistics.

### 1. Resolved addresses

This option helps identify IP addresses and DNS names available in the capture file by providing the list of the resolved addresses and their hostnames.

The search bar allows for quick identification of specific information, such as IP addresses or hostnames.

### 2.Conversations

Conversation represents traffic between two specific endpoints.

### 3.Endpoints

The endpoints option is similar to the conversations option. The only difference is that this option provides unique information for a single information field.

### 4.IPv4 and IPv6

This sections provide summarized traffic statistics for IPv4 and IPv6 packets captured during analysis.

For example, we can view the most commonly used IPv4 address:

### 5.DNS

This option breaks down all DNS packets from the capture file and helps analysts view the findings in a tree view based on packet counters and percentages of the DNS protocol.

For example, we can view min service request-response time of the DNS packets:

### 6.HTTP

This option breaks down all HTTP packets from the capture file:

For example, we can view  the number of HTTP Requests accomplished by specific IP address
